# About
In the COVID-19 era, the risk of an inefficient shopping experience can be fatal. Retail businesses and their customers need a system that both maximizes safety and optimizes store function. That's why we created Make My Meals, a mobile website that uses smart technology to create a recipe plan to a customer based on an item of their choosing. With the power of pathfinding algorithms, object recognition, and NCR's cloud service, users are provided with the fastest route throughout the store to grab the items that they need and quickly checkout online.

# What it does
* After a user uploads an image of an item at a grocery store, the application identifies the item and generates relevant recipes that have ingredients available at the current store.

* Once a recipe is chosen, the application generates the map of the store which has the shortest path between all of the required ingredients to make the recipe.

* Helps merchants maximize store efficiency based on popular user recipes and promotes a safe shopping experience during the pandemic.

* Utilizing NCRâ€™s cloud APIs, we can allow retailers to accept contactless, germ-free transactions and bring an online experience to their brick and mortar stores.

* By reimagining commerce, we are disrupting the grocery store model by influencing product discovery and managing payments.
